In case you are here, you are probably missing Levels folder.

This folder is important, as it contains all level information.
Structure is pretty basic. In Levels folder you basically add folders starting from 0 and go up. That will be our difficulty modes.
In each of them there should be info.txt file with name of the mode.
Now to add a level to the mode you simply make 1.txt (Sudoku board) file and so on.

Each sudoku board file consists of 9lines of 9digits, so it's pretty simple. 0 stands for empty field.

This is how example folder will look like:
